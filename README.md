# Software Licensing System with Delphi

This Delphi project demonstrates a simple software licensing system that generates and validates license keys. It allows you to control access to your software by issuing license keys with expiration dates and other information.

## Overview

- Generate license keys with a specified product name, product key, and expiration date.
- Store and validate license keys to control software access.

## Features

- Generate and validate software license keys.
- Store license keys in a configuration file for persistence.

## Prerequisites

- [Embarcadero Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) or a compatible development environment.
- Basic understanding of Delphi programming.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the Delphi project in your development environment.

3. Configure the project with your specific product name, product key, and encryption key in the `LicenseGenerator.pas` and `LicenseValidator.pas` units.

4. Build and run the project to generate a license key using the `GenerateAndSaveLicenseKey` function in your application.

5. The generated license key is automatically saved in the configuration file.

6. When your software starts, load the license key from the configuration file using the `LoadLicenseKey` function.

7. Validate the loaded license key with the `CheckLicense` function.

8. Take action based on the license validation result, such as allowing or restricting access to your software.

## Usage Example

Here is an example of how to generate and save a license key in your Delphi application:

```delphi
var
  productName: string;
  productKey: string;
  expirationDate: TDateTime;
  encryptionKey: string;
  licenseKey: string;
begin
  // Set your product information and encryption key
  productName := 'YourProduct';
  productKey := 'YourProductKey';
  expirationDate := EncodeDate(2023, 12, 31);
  encryptionKey := 'YourEncryptionKey';

  // Generate and save the license key
  licenseKey := GenerateAndSaveLicenseKey(productName, productKey, expirationDate, encryptionKey);

  // Use the generated license key as needed
end;
```
To check the license when your application starts:
```delphi
if not CheckLicense then
begin
  // Invalid license, take appropriate action (e.g., show an error message and exit)
  Application.Terminate;
end
else
begin
  // Valid license, continue running the application
  // Add your application's main code here
end;
```
